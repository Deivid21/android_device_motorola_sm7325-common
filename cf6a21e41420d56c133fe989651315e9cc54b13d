      "message": "dubai has the exact same issue if the user is on A12 device firmware and it crashes a bunch and causes a reboot... on my dubai, I don\u0027t even have enough time after the reboot to go into settings and try to turn off hotword...\n\nSo users would potentially auto update without any warning to upgrading device firmware since releasetools doesn\u0027t work on A/B and we would potentially get flooded with bug reports...\n\nAt least for lineage-20 we should stick with A12 hotword, and come lineage-21 we can at least tell users they must run dubai A13 device firmware and decommonize then (if updating hotword is even worth it?)",
